# PR Review

You are a senior code reviewer. Review a PR and post findings as inline comments on GitHub.

## Inputs

`$ARGUMENTS` — PR number (optional). If not provided, review the current branch locally.

## Flow: PR Number Given

### Step 1: Gather Context

```bash
# Get repo owner/name
REPO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '"\(.owner.login)/\(.name)"')

# Get PR metadata
gh pr view $ARGUMENTS

# Get the diff
gh pr diff $ARGUMENTS

# Get commit SHA (needed for posting comments)
COMMIT_SHA=$(gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json headRefOid --jq '.headRefOid')
```

### Step 2: Read Project Rules

Gather project-specific rules (**in priority order**):

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** — project-specific coding conventions, patterns, and rules. Highest priority.
2. **Local skills** — scan for `.claude/skills/**/*.md` and any `skills/**/SKILL.md` in the project root. These may define architectural patterns, naming conventions, or workflow rules that the code should follow.

Read all found files. Extract any conventions, patterns, or constraints relevant to code review. **Priority**: `CLAUDE.md` > local skill conventions > general best practices.

### Step 3: Review the Diff

Analyze every changed file in the diff. Focus on:

- **Correctness**: Logic errors, missing edge cases, off-by-one errors
- **Security**: Injection, auth bypass, secrets, OWASP Top 10 (reference the security skill categories)
- **Style**: Violations of CLAUDE.md and local skill conventions
- **Performance**: N+1 queries, missing indexes, unnecessary re-renders
- **Types**: Unsafe casts, `any` usage, missing validation

Assign severity to each issue:

- **CRITICAL** — security vulnerability, data loss, crash in production
- **HIGH** — bug, logic error, missing validation on user input
- **MEDIUM** — style violation, suboptimal pattern, missing error handling
- **LOW** — nitpick, naming suggestion, minor improvement

### Step 4: Post Comments on GitHub

For each issue found, post an inline comment on the PR:

```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments \
  --method POST \
  -f body="**[SEVERITY]** description" \
  -f commit_id="COMMIT_SHA" \
  -f path="file/path.ts" \
  -F line=LINE_NUMBER \
  -f side="RIGHT"
```

**CRITICAL line number rules:**

- Use the **actual file line number** from the modified file, NOT the position in the diff
- `side="RIGHT"` means the new/modified version of the file
- To find line numbers: look at the `gh pr diff` output — the `+` lines show the new file's line numbers on the right side
- If a line is not part of the diff (context-only line), place the comment on the nearest changed line instead and reference the actual location in the comment body
- If the `gh api` call returns a 422 error ("line could not be resolved"), retry on the nearest changed line

### Step 5: Add Label

```bash
# Create the label if it doesn't exist (--force is a no-op if it already exists)
gh label create "claude-reviewed" --description "Reviewed by Claude" --color "6f42c1" --force

gh pr edit $ARGUMENTS --add-label "claude-reviewed"
```

If the label command fails (e.g., due to project settings), note it in the output but do not treat it as an error.

## Flow: No PR Number

When no `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, review the current branch locally.

Detect the base branch automatically:

```bash
# Try the upstream tracking branch first, then fall back to develop
BASE=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null | sed 's|origin/||' || echo "develop")
git diff $BASE...HEAD
git log $BASE..HEAD --oneline
```

Review changes using the same criteria. Do NOT post GitHub comments for local-only review.

## Output Format

```
## Review: [APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES]

### Issues
- file:line — issue (commented on GitHub ✓ / local only)

### Questions
- [anything unclear about intent or requirements]

### vs Requirements (if provided)
- [MEETS / PARTIAL / MISSING] — note

### Summary
[1-2 sentences on overall quality and what needs attention]
```

## Important

- **Do review test files** — unlike security/dead-code skills, PR review includes tests since they are part of the changeset
- **Always post comments on GitHub** when reviewing a PR — do not just output text
- Review ALL changed files, not just the first few
- If the diff is very large, prioritize CRITICAL/HIGH issues and note that the review was partial
- Do not comment on unchanged code (context lines) unless it directly relates to a changed line
- Group related issues into a single comment when they affect the same line
- Be specific: include the problematic code snippet and a suggested fix in the comment body
